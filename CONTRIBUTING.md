## Getting Started üöÄ

1. **Fork the repository** on GitLab.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.msu.edu/your-username/ewxpwsdb.git
   cd ewxpwsdb
   ```

## Setting Up the Development Environment üõ†Ô∏è

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for dependency management and packaging. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment.

### Installing Poetry

#### Recommended: Using `pipx`

1. **Install `pipx`**:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --user pipx
   python -m pipx ensurepath
   ```

2. **Install Poetry**:
   ```bash
   pipx install poetry
   ```

#### Alternative: Using the Official Installer

Refer to the [Poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for alternative installation methods.

### Installing Dependencies

Once Poetry is installed, run the following commands to install the project dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

### Activating the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment created by Poetry, run:

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Database Setup üóÑÔ∏è

We use PostgreSQL for our database. Follow these steps to set up your database environment.

### Installing PostgreSQL

#### macOS

We recommend using [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com).

1. **Download and install Postgres.app**.
2. **Start the server and create a new database** (e.g., `ewxpws`).

#### Windows & Linux

Refer to the [PostgreSQL official installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) for your operating system.

### Setting Up the Database

1. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root directory and set the database URL:
   ```ini
   EWXPWSDB_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://user:password@localhost:5432/ewxpws
   ```

2. **Initialize the database**:
   ```bash
   poetry run python -m ewxpwsdb.db.database init_db
   ```

## Running Tests üß™

### Getting Test Data

Ensure you have the test stations file (`data/test_stations.tsv`). This file contains credentials and is required for running tests.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests
```

### Test Options

For custom test options, you can use:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests --station_type=STATION_TYPE --dburl=DBURL --file=FILE --no-import
```

### Example

To run tests for a specific station type:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests --station_type=ZENTRA
```

## Creating a Merge Request (MR) üì§

1. **Create a new branch** for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b issue-number-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards.

3. **Commit your changes** with a descriptive message, including the issue number:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fix issue #123: Corrected off-by-one error"
   ```

4. **Push your branch** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin issue-number-description
   ```

5. **Create a merge request** on GitLab and fill in the template. Make sure to select:
   - `Delete source branch when merge request is accepted.`
   - `Squash commits when merge request is accepted.`

6. **Request a review** from the project maintainers.

## Coding Standards üßπ

To ensure consistency and readability, adhere to the following standards:

- **PEP 8**: Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.
- **Docstrings**: Write clear and concise docstrings for all public methods and classes.
- **Type Annotations**: Use type annotations to specify the expected types of function arguments and return values.
- **Commit Messages**: Write meaningful commit messages that describe what the commit does.

## Using the CLI

There is a command line interface for working with the database and APIs using the terminal/command.exe.

1. **List all stations**:
   ```bash
   poetry run ewxpws station list
   ```

2. **Get current weather details, directly from API**:
   ```bash
   poetry run ewxpws weather {station code}
   ```

3. **Get recent hourly weather summary from database**:
   ```bash
   poetry run ewxpws hourly {station code}
   ```

For many of these commands, there are options for `--start` and `--stop` to get a range of data. For hourly data, these are dates in the form `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Starting the API

To start the API server on your local computer, use the command line script:

```bash
poetry run ewxpws startapi -d <database_url>
```

This runs on host address `http://0.0.0.0:8000`, but the host IP and the port address can be overridden. The server can be run using SSL with local cert and key files, with the `--ssl` option (off by default).

### Starting a Dev API Server

For development with FastAPI, set the database variable in `.env` and run:

```bash
poetry run fastapi dev src/ewxpwsdb/api/http_api.py
```

This will auto-reload as code changes.

To run with a different database (e.g., on a different server), add the URL to the environment:

```shell
source .env
EWXPWSDB_URL=$EWXPWSDB_AWS_URL; poetry run fastapi dev src/ewxpwsdb/api/http_api.py
```

### Using the API

Once the server is running, browse to `http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs` for documentation about the API. Several other routes are available. For example, `http://0.0.0.0:8000/stations` lists station codes. All data is output in JSON format.

## Docker Setup üê≥

This includes a simplistic `Dockerfile` to run the API server for giving out the data. It copies all files (including `/data` which is not needed except to initialize the DB).

### Building the Docker Image

To build a new image:

```bash
TAG=v0; docker buildx build -t ewxpwsdb:$TAG .
```

### Running the Docker Container

To run the container:

```bash
docker run -d --env-file=docker.env -p 80:80 ewxpwsdb:v0
```

Ensure you have a `.env` file to support Docker with an external DB URL and cert locations. Example `.env` contents:

```ini
EWXPWSDB_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://localhost:5432/ewxpws
EWXPWSDB_DOCKER_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://ewxuser:password@ewxpwsdev-db.etc.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/ewxpws
```

To use this from the command line:

```shell
source .env; docker run -d --env-file=docker.env  -e EWXPWSDB_URL=$EWXPWSDB_D

OCKER_URL  -p 80:80 ewxpwsdb:v0
```
