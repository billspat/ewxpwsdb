# Enviroweather (EWX) Personal Weather Station (PWS) Database (DB): ewxpwsdb

This package is to support the Personal Weather Station project of the https://enviroweather.msu.edu project.  

This is v2 or reconfiguration of previous packages to better combine classes to collect and harmonize data from diverse weather station vendor APIs, 
SQL database of weather stations and readings, data collection orchestration/workflow, and an API wrapper around all of these function with type-checked code.  

This package is under heavy development and in transition from previous version. 

More details about how to use the package as well as how to contribute to it's development is coming. 

### Developers

The package uses Python 'poetry' rather than standard setup tools.  Poetry suggests installing in a virtual environment, however it already creates a virtual environment for this package. 

Details will follow.
